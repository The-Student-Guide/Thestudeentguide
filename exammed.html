        NEET</b></h>
      <p>The National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) UG will be conducted by the NTA from 2019 onwards. This Test
        was being conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) till 2018. NEET (UG) is applicable for
        admission to MBBS/BDS Courses in India in Medical/Dental Colleges run with the approval of Medical Council of
        India/Dental Council of India under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India except
        for the institutions established through an Act of Parliament i.e. AIIMS and JIPMER Puducherry. .</p>

      <h1 style="text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; color:red;"><b>
          AIIMS</b></h>
        <p>An Act of Parliament in 1956 established the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) as an autonomous
          institution of national importance and defined its objectives and functions. By virtue of this Act, the
          Institute awards its own medical degrees and other academic distinctions. The degrees awarded by the Institute
          under the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Act are recognized medical qualifications for the purpose of
          the Indian Medical Council Act and notwithstanding anything contained therein, are deemed to be included in
          the first schedule of that Act, entitling the holders to the same privileges as those attached to the
          equivalent awards from the recognized Universities of India. .</p>
        <h1 style="text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; color:red;"><b>
            JIPMER</b></h>
          <p> Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) can trace its origins to the
            ‘Ecole de Medicine de Pondicherry’ established by the French Government in 1823. In 1956 foundation for new
            medical college was laid and in 1964, hospital was inaugurated. JIPMER became an institution of national
            importance under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India in the year 2008. It is an
            institution established for teaching, research and patient care in the area of health. JIPMER spreads over
            192 acres. The institution houses one administrative block, one academic centre, one nursing college, seven
            hospital blocks, seven accessory services buildings and four residential complexes. 12 broad types of
            medical, nursing and allied health science courses covering all disciplines in healthcare from basic to
            super speciality training are conducted.

            JIPMER is one among the very few institutions in the country which is providing teaching from undergraduate
            to superspeciality & sub-specialties, conducting path breaking research and providing specialty care of high
            order. The model of providing free specialty health care while maintaining quality and safety makes JIPMER a
            unique model in the country. JIPMER’s success in providing best treatment even to the least affordable in
            the society makes it a model of speciality care delivery of the future. JIPMER continues to rank among the
            top best five medical schools in the country. JIPMER is witnessing expansion in the form of new campuses
            like JIPMER Karaikkal, JIPMER outreach centre at Yanam apart from the soon to be commissioned screening OPD
            block and superspeciality extention block. Conceptual plans for Puducherry second campus for Institute of
            organ transplantation and Institute of advanced trauma and rehabilitation were initiated during this period.
