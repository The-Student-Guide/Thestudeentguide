    Chartered accountants work in all fields of business and finance, including auditing, taxation, financial and general management. Some are engaged in public practice work, others work in the private sector and some are employed by government bodies.
<div>
    Entry to the profession can be made by taking the CA Foundation Course after completion of schooling (12th grade).
     Alternatively, graduates may train as an articled assistant for three years in a chartered firm before final exam or after completion of Intermediate of Cost Accountant or Company Secretary. 
     A comprehensive 100 hours of information technology training and an orientation programme for soft skills development have to be completed before being articled.However the CA certification is limited to the geographical boundary of India and is not valid in countries that follow different standards of accounting practice.
