      In the past, there were only four major branches in engineering and they were Mechanical, Chemical, Civil and
      Electrical. However, there were many sub-branches of each discipline. Now there are plenty of branches
      in engineering providing a greater choice for passionate students.</p>

      height="500">
    <p> Computer science and information technology is the most demanding branch in engineering and the requirement
      in this field will continue to rise in the years to come.
      A career in computer science engineering is considered to be one of the most high-paying
      jobs and there are plenty of opportunities, IT companies employ a huge number of computer professionals every
      year.
      This is the branch of the most scope field in the engineering sector which is booming currently in India.Computer
      engineers can choose plenty of
      options to work in IT companies in various departments such as design, development, assembly, manufacture and
      maintenance, working as programmer, web developer, and e-commerce specialist, automotive companies, aerospace
      companies, etc. Job opportunities are available for graduates in government as well as the Private sector.</p>
    <h3><b> Mechanical Engineering </b> </h3>
    <img  src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.hO_26221IZnwdCq8N2k0jQHaEK&pid=Api&P=0&w=304&h=172"
      width="700" height="500">
    <p>
      Mechanical Engineering is one of the oldest and broadest among engineering.
      It deals with manufacture and maintain machines and thus the students require an understanding in the core areas
      such as mechanics,
      dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. Mechanical Engineers can find
      employment in both private as well as government sectors. They are required to design, test, install, manufacture,
      operate and maintain an overview of machines and mechanical systems that are used in multiple industries.</p>
    <h3><b> Electrical & Electronics Engineering </b> </h3>
    <img 
      src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/y5wWQR9VGX/sizes/electricalengineeringmain11_md.jpg"
      width="700" height="500">
    <p>Electrical engineers deal with designing electronic circuits and devices utilizing non-linear and active
      electrical components such as the diode, transistors and so on.
      It has a continuous demand for electricity boards, power sector organizations like NTPC, PSUs, railways, and
      defence forces.
      They are hired in the IT sector with various job opportunities. Electrical engineers will work on a wide range of
      components, devices, and systems, from small microchips to huge power station generators. Electrical Engineers
      design, test, develop and operate the manufacturing of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, navigation
      systems, communications systems and power generation equipment.</p>
    <h3><b> Civil Engineering </b> </h3>
    <img
