            Extracurricular activities are available to all college students. They typically take place on campus, but
            they are optional and do not interfere with your required courses. Extracurricular activities can include
            social clubs, sports teams, student government, volunteering, or even an internship.
            <p>
                Below, learn about a few of the most popular choices for extracurricular activities. This post also
                discusses how they can be especially beneficial to international students.</p>
            <p>
                It can often be a challenge for students to build relationships when moving to a new place. Getting
                involved in activities outside of school can help students meet new people with whom they share
                interests. You will improve your social skills as a result.
            </p>
            Extracurricular activities also help students expand their networks, which is beneficial for finding career
            opportunities after graduation. For example, if you join an environmental group at school, your peers might
            go on to work for environmental organizations. In the future, you could use one of those colleagues as a
            reference when you apply for a job in that field.
