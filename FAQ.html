      <td><b>What Course/Stream shall I choose if I wish to appear
          for IAS/IPS/UPSE/Civil Service Examination?</b>
        <br><li>
        Any candidate with minimum 21 Years of Age and having completed Graduation from ANY STREAM can appear for
        the Exam.
        Traditionally Students preferred BA as graduation because that degree gave time for preparation, but off late I
        see students from all fields be it Medicine, Engineering or Commerce cracking the exam. One latest trend which I
        see is students go 5 Year LAW after 12th and then give UPSC Exam.This helps them in three ways: Firstly, the
        legal studies are iin line with the study
        requirements of UPSC, so preparation takes place automatically. Secondly, Legal Studies also open door to
        Judiciary Examinations.Thirdly, even if the candidate is unable to clear the exam, he/she has a professional
        degree in hand and can
        pursue profession as a lawyer.</li>
